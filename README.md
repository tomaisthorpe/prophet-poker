# Prophet Poker

Web-based planning poker application. It uses WebRTC for peer-to-peer client communication. No data is stored on any server - all information is shared directly between the clients with one client acting as the host.
The app relies on [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/) to make handling WebRTC a little easier.
